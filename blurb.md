# CSC 232. Competitive Programming 0-2-1  

This course is intended to help you raise your proficiency in computer programming to a higher level of competency, and expose you to the rewards and satisfaction of clever craftsmanship, elegant coding, and performant hacking. The goal is to achieve this through programming puzzles and challenges from international programming competitions*, all the while improving your algorithmic thinking and coding skills. We will learn to design time- and space-efficient algorithms to solve challenging contest problems, and produce bug-free code under the pressure of time in contest.

Anticipated outcomes of the course:
- Learn how to do fast problem and input analysis
- Pick up lots of useful algorithms, data structures, and mathematical techniques in an applied/practical setting
- Develop skills in rapid testing, optimizing, and debugging of code.
- Great practice for technical interviews (jobs & internships)
- Learn how to work effectively in a team
- Have fun, maybe win prizes and glory

This course is designed to be repeatable -- and the idea is for everyone to work at their own pace, at their own level, as much as possible. If you retake the course, you'll be expected to tackle more challenging topics the second (or third) time around.

The programming language(s) introduced/used in the course will be Python (although you are welcome to use something else - e.g. Java -- depending on your prior experience).

For students who wish to, after the course, there may be opportunities to participate in a Berry College programming team at one or more regional programming contests in the fall/spring.

Official catalog course description:<br>
*This lab-based, hands-on course focuses on the development of skills for participating in programming competitions and whiteboard-coding technical interviews. Recognizing core computational tasks underlying a task description, applying known algorithms and data structures, developing and using provided test cases, strategies for working with a team and under time constraints, and articulating thought processes and designs. Students who repeat the course will be expected to develop proficiency with progressively more difficult algorithmic problems. May be repeated for credit with permission of instructor. A maximum of 3 credit hours may be counted towards additional elective credit for the Computer Science major or minor. PR: CSC 120.*
